# Ubuntu Provisioning

## Overview

This Ansible playbook collection can be used to easily create and customize a 
bootable ISO image of Ubuntu Base, deploy it to a USB thumb drive, test/use it, 
and optionally provision the same image to the computer to which the drive is 
connected...similar to what can be done with the Ubuntu Desktop ISO image 
provided on the official website. The difference here is that you start with a 
very minimal version of Ubuntu and can automate virtually the entire process, 
including deployment over the network in a pre-execution environment (PXE)*.

<sup>*PXE-based provisioning coming soon!</sup>

TODO: finish the readme after adding support for PXE
